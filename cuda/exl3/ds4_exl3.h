/* ds4 entry points for the vendored exllamav3 EXL3 GEMM kernels (see VENDOR.md).
 *
 * Every activation is fp32 on both sides, as everywhere in ds4's qwen4exp
 * graph; the kernels convert to fp16 inside their input Hadamard phase.  A
 * trellis tensor is addressed by three device pointers -- the tiles, the
 * fp16 input scale vector suh[k] and the fp16 output vector svh[n] -- which
 * the GGUF stores back to back in one tensor payload (ds4.c, exl3_scale_bytes).
 *
 * The kernels are cooperative launches (grid-wide barriers between the input
 * transform and the matmul, and between 16-row passes), so a grid is at most
 * the device's co-resident block count and needs the per-stream lock buffer
 * this file owns.  Both entries return 1 on success, 0 on failure. */
